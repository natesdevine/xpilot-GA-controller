# xpilot-GA-controller
An artificially intelligent (genetic algorithm based) controller for use as a combat agent in Xpilot-AI

genetic_algorithm.py contains the actual genetic algorithm which is used by evolve_xpilot_agent_using_GA.py to train increasingly better agents. 

trained_controller.py is an example of an xpilot agent that my GA trained for 600 generations.
